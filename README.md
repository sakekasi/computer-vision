# computer-vision
accompanying code exercises and experiments for szeliski's "Computer Vision"

Each `.ipynb` file contains an exploration and implementation of a concept relating to computer vision. Here, I aim to
gain a deeper understanding of computer vision concepts, as well as to figure out effective ways to use the
program notebook medium to aid understanding, explanation, and exploration.
